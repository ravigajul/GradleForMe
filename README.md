# GradleForMe
Gradle is an open-source build automation tool that is designed for multi-project builds and supports multiple programming languages. It is often used for building, testing, and deploying software projects. Gradle uses a **Groovy** or **Kotlin-based DSL** (Domain-Specific Language) to define build scripts, making it flexible and expressive.
